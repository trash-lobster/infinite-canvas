`getAttribLocation(program : ShaderProgram, attributeName : string)` - finds the location of the attribute in the vertex shader. This should be done during initialisation, not render loop.

`viewport(x: GLint, y: GLint, width: GLsizei, height: GLsizei)` - `x` is the horizontal value of the lower-left corner of the origin of the **viewport**. `y` is the vertical value of the lower-left corner of the origin.
